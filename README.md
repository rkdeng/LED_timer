# LED_timer
This is a timer using an RGB LED ring as a display. Time is encoded by the number and color of the RGB lights. A rotary encoder is used to control the time. When time is up, a short melody is played through a small piezo buzzer. Everything is controlled by an Arduino nano.  
Here is a short demo:
